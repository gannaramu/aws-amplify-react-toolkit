# Amazon Cognito UI Tester

This project was inspired by the [Kinesis Data Generator](https://awslabs.github.io/amazon-kinesis-data-generator/web/producer.html).

The idea is that I wanted to create a simple web UI where any user could plug in their Cognito credentials and then have a barebones template from which they can interact with their AWS resources using an associated Cognito Identity Pool with their Cognito User Pool.

# Demo

https://matwerber1.github.io/amazon-cognito-ui-tester

# Setup 

Manually create a Cognito User Pool and within that user pool, create an application client. Also create and associate a Cognito Identity Pool to the Cognito User Pool. 

For the "Auth" role associated to the identity pool, give the role whatever AWS IAM permissions you want to build into your browser app. 

This example displays a widget after you log in that attempts to call EC2.DescribeInstances(), so you should at least give your auth role that permission if you want to see everything work.  



# Usage

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
